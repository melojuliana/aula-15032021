                    Exo broke its first records years after its debut and, even today after almost 10 years of career, it has been breaking records both nationally and internationally, as being the first group to have their music played in the "Dubai Fountain" which is the biggest source of dancing waters in the world, as the first group to do the closing ceremony of the 2018 Olympics in their home country.
                    Currently the group has some sub-units, which are: EXO-CBX and EXO-SC and all its members have their solo work as singers, actors and consolidated models. The group has been on hiatus since 2019, as some of its members are doing their country's mandatory military service.
